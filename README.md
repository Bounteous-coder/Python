This Python program manages meal orders for a group of invitees and calculates the total cost, including tax and tips. 
The program prompts the user to enter the number of invitees and asks each invitee questions to determine their meal preferences, such as keto, vegan, and gluten-free options. 
Based on their responses, the program assigns a dish (pizza, pasta, falafel, steak, or beverage) to each invitee. 
It calculates the total cost for each dish, applies tax, and allows the user to input a tip percentage. 
Finally, the program generates a detailed receipt showing the number of orders for each dish, their costs, and the final total after tax and tips.

dinner.py is the Project file.
