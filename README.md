This project is a simple PC shop simulation implemented in Python, where users can either build a custom PC by selecting individual components or purchase a pre-built PC from a predefined list.
The program starts by welcoming the user and presents various options for SSDs, HDDs, CPUs, motherboards, RAM, graphics cards, PSUs, and cases. 
If the user opts to build a custom PC, they choose components step-by-step, ensuring compatibility between parts. If they choose a pre-built PC, they select from available models. 
The total cost is calculated and displayed at the end, along with a summary of selected items. 
This simulation provides an interactive way to explore PC building and purchasing, offering a straightforward and user-friendly approach to assembling a custom or pre-built computer.
